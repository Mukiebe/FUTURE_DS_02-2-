# FUTURE_DS_02-2
As I continue building my Data Analytics experience in my third month, I'm excited to share my Task 02 (Data Science & Analytics) 



Project: Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker built in Power BI 



For this project, I worked through the end-to-end analytics workflow using simulated Facebook Ads Manager data:

Data Cleaning & Preparation – managed missing values, removed duplicates, and dropped irrelevant fields to ensure data accuracy

Data Transformation – structured campaign data for KPIs like CTR, CPC, and ROI

Power BI & DAX – created calculated measures and aggregations for dynamic analysis

Visualization – designed interactive dashboards for campaign performance review



The final Power BI dashboard includes:

Campaign KPIs – CPC, CTR, Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, and Spend.

Audience Insights – CTR by Age and Gender breakdowns.

Trend Analysis – Conversions vs. Spend and Impressions vs. Clicks over time.

Top Performing Ads – identified highest CTR by ad ID.

Spend by Interest Groups – highlighted how budget allocation impacted engagement.

Interactive Filters – allowing analysis by demographics and campaign segments.



Grateful for this opportunity to learn through the Future Interns program and excited to keep building on these skills!
